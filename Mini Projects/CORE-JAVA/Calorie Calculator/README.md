Project : Calorie Calculator

Problem Statement:

Fuji likes bread so much. She eats bread daily. She eats bread with butter and jam or sometimes jam alone. Rarely she eats bread alone. But she wants to know which gives her more energy. So she want to calculate how much energy she gains from the bread that she eats. Help her in finding the amount of energy gained from given calories.
1 kcal=4.1868 kJ
Bread=74 calories
Butter=102 calories
Jam=26 calories
Write a java program to calculate the energy and implement it using Method overloading concept. Print energy with three decimal places.
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name, but their arguments type or the return type of the method or the number of arguments are different.

i. Create two class namely, Main and Calories.
ii. Get all details in Main class.
iii. Include a method called, calculateCalories() which is overloaded three times.
iv. First calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats only bread.
v. Second calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats bread and jam.
vi. Third calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats bread, butter and Jam.
vii. Include a method called returnCalories() that returns the calculated calories.
viii. Include a method called calculateEnergy() that calculates the energy and returns the energy value.
Sample input and output 1:
1.Bread only
2.Bread+Jam
3.Bread+Jam+Butter
Enter the choice
2
Enter the number of Slice of bread
2
Enter the number of teaspoon of Jam
4
